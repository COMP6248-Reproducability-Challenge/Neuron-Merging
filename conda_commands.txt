# create new environment and install dependencies from file
conda env create -f ./environment.yml

# update an environment (if install during first command fails, you need to use this after)
conda env update -f envornment.yml -n neuron_merging

# start using the environment
conda activate neuron_merging

# stop using the environment
conda deactivate

# list environments
conda info --envs

# remove an environment
conda remove --name neuron_merging --all

# search available package versions on conda
conda search package_name (e.g. conda search freetype)

# ResolvePackageNotFound error
put the listed packages under pip in environment.yml
e.g.
ResolvePackageNotFound:
- numpy==1.18.1=py38h4f9e942_0
in environment.yml under dependencies
- pip:
  - numpy==1.18.1=py38h4f9e942_0
then remove it from the dependencies (so there are no duplicates)
